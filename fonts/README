This font is based on the standard UN*X command banner(6)
by Mark Horton, 1993.

1.1

banner(6) is the "original" banner or at least the one most are familiar with.
Hence this font (it is one font, in various sizes) is called Obanner short for
Original banner; as opposed to the banner shipped with figlet ;-).

1.2

The numbers at the end of the filename correspond to the size of the font,
Obanner80 contains the output of banner -w 80; which is not really 80 columns.

2.1 Output Width

You should use -w 1 when using the Obanner font.
banner(6) creates vertical output and therefore only one character per row;
you can get some interesting output otherwise ;-)

2.2 Output Exactitude

Due to the way figlet is designed this font cannot exactly replicate
banner(6) output without a little help.

1. banner -w 16 foo
2. figlet -f Obanner16 -w 1 -A foo
3. figlet -f Obanner16 -w 1 -A foo | perl -p -e 's/^\s+$//'

1.                2.             3.
